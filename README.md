Quantifying the "rubber band effect" in NCAAM


## Data Description

The data used in this analysis was collected off of Kaggle, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robbypeery/college-basketball-pbp-23-24?resource=download). This data is free and available for download. It can be downloaded by clicking the "Download" button on the Kaggle page. The dataset is already very clean and didn't have any erroneous data. However, the dataset struggled to capture some possession data, especially for the smaller conference teams. This is to be expected, as the data is collected from play-by-play logs that are manually entered by statisticians at each game. In order to account for this, we filtered our dataset to only include games that had clean possession data for both teams. The dataset was collected to provide a comprehensive view of college basketball games, including play-by-play events, scores, and other relevant statistics. This data is often used for sports analytics, performance analysis, and strategic planning by teams and analysts.

The creator of the dataset is Robby Peery, who is a data scientist and sports enthusiast. He collected the data to provide a resource for sports analysts, researchers, and fans interested in college basketball statistics. The dataset aims to facilitate analysis and insights into game dynamics, player performance, and team strategies.


## Phenomenon Description
What phenomenon are you modeling? Provide a brief background on the topic, including definitions and details that are relevant to your analysis. Clearly describe its main features, and support those claims with data where appropriate. (10/100 pts)

This project seeks to model the 'rubber band effect' in NCAA and professional basketball. The premise of this effect is that a large score differential between two teams usually trends closer to zero, and this is primarily because the leading team relaxes their effort while the trailing team exerts more effort to catch up. This effect is often discussed in sports analytics circles as a psychological phenomenon that can influence the outcome of games. *****WE NEED TO SUPPORT WITH DATA ******


## Non-Parametric Model Description
Describe your non-parametric model (empirical cumulative distribution functions, kernel density function, local constant least squares regression, Markov transition models). How are you fitting your model to the phenomenon to get realistic properties of the data? What challenges did you have to overcome? (15/100 pts)

Our model is a Markov transition model that defines states based on score differential intervals. The states are defined as follows: [-30,-25), [-25,-20), [-20,-15), [-15,-10), [-10,-5), [-5,0), [0,5), [5,10), [10,15), [15,20), [20,25), [25,30) where each of the values represents a score differential. The transition time periods are 10 possessions, or 5 possessions per team. A typical team will have between 70 and 80 combined possessions per half. We fit the model by estimating the transition probabilities between these states using historical game data. The games from the 2023-2024 NCAAM season (6000+) were broken up into segments of 10 possessions, and the score differential at the start and end of each segment was recorded. The transition matrix was then constructed by calculating the frequency of transitions from one state to another and normalizing these frequencies to obtain probabilities. These probabilities were then used to populate the transition matrix. One interesting note was that teams can't go from a large negative differential to a large positive differential in a single time step (since it's not common to gain something like 30 points within one 10-possession time interval), so many of the transition probabilities in the matrix are zero. This sparsity was a challenge when simulating sequences, as it limited the possible transitions that could occur in certain states. But because of our efforts to still populate the transition matrix accurately, we were able to create a realistic model of score differential changes over time in basketball games.


## Simulation

Either use your model to create new sequences (if the model is more generative) or bootstrap a quantity of interest (if the model is more inferential). (15/100 pts)

The simulation code is located in `simulation.ipynb`. We simulated the UVA vs. NC Central game from the 2025-2026 season starting at halftime. UVA was up 17 points at half, and then we modeled the second half of the game as a Markov process with states defined by score differential intervals. The transition matrix was estimated from historical data of similar games. The simulation runs 360 iterations of the second half, each consisting of 7 time steps (representing possessions). The results are visualized using a lineplot showing the evolution of the score differential over time. You can clearly see that coming out of the second half, UVA fights the rubber band effect and increases their lead over NC Central. But then as time progresses and the game continues, the score differential trends back downwards, demonstrating the rubber band effect as NC Central catches up. The simulation is plotted over various simulations using the Markov transition model to show the variability in outcomes. While the actual score does not explicitly follow the average trend of the simulations, it does show the same general pattern of the score differential decreasing over time, indicating that the rubber band effect is present in the actual game as well.

## Critical Evaluation
Critically evaluate your work in part 4. Do your sequences have the properties of the training data, and if not, why not? Are your estimates credible and reliable, or is there substantial uncertainty in your results? (15/100 pts)

Our data had meaningfully fewer observations for the tail score differential buckets; hence we're less certain in the magnitude (not direction) of the rubber band effect at those states. The [25, 30) and [-30, 25) buckets, for example, account for less than 200 total observations whereas the middle states (e.g., [0, 5)) have over 8,000. The simulated sequences do, in fact, have the same properties as the training data, with the most frequent simulated paths converging gradually to zero.


## Conclusion

This project set out to model point-differential state transitions within NCAA Men’s Basketball using play-by-play data from the 2023, 2024 season, with the broader goal of identifying and quantifying the “rubber band effect.” By organizing score differentials into categorical 5-point ranges and fitting a Markov transition model to historical game segments, we attempted to capture whether teams with large leads tend to regress toward tighter margins over time, and whether trailing teams exhibit accelerated scoring behavior as they try to close the gap.

Overall, the Markov transition model produced transition patterns that align with the qualitative descriptions of the rubber band effect. The thick diagonal structure of the transition matrix, which shows that most transitions occur between adjacent score-differential buckets, supports the idea that score changes tend to be gradual rather than extreme. Furthermore, simulations run on a real 2025, 2026 UVA vs. NC Central game showed evidence consistent with the effect. Although UVA extended its lead early in the second half, the simulated trajectories, and the actual play-by-play, tended to drift back toward a smaller margin as time passed.

However, several key limitations shape the reliability of these results. First, the use of 5-point categorical buckets, while necessary to reduce the size of the state space, inevitably discards fine-grained scoring information. These buckets can obscure rapid sequences of scoring or unusual momentum swings, and they restrict the model by forcing most transitions to occur locally from one bucket to the next. This simplification is visible in the transition matrix and may partially explain why extreme state changes are rare in the simulation.

Second, the data itself introduces uncertainty. Extreme score differentials, which represent large leads or deficits, occur far less frequently in Division I games, meaning those transition probabilities are estimated from relatively small sample sizes. This leads to wider confidence intervals and increased volatility when simulating rare events. Additionally, play-by-play logs do not capture contextual factors that influence team behavior. Lineup changes, fatigue, injuries, officiating patterns, travel schedules, and game importance all contribute to momentum and strategy but are not encoded in the dataset.

Third, the model assumes stationarity, meaning that transition probabilities remain the same throughout a game and across teams, which is almost certainly false. Teams behave differently in early versus late-game situations, in conference matchups, and under pressure scenarios such as tournament play. Without incorporating context, the model captures only an averaged-out behavior rather than true dynamic strategies.

Moving forward, several improvements could significantly enhance the quality and predictive power of the model. One promising direction is the development of a team-state or momentum meter that quantifies contextual factors such as efficiency, fatigue, or lineup strength and incorporates them into the transition structure. Another avenue is to build a Markov model whose transition probabilities vary by game period or possession number. A more ambitious extension would introduce player-level or lineup-level data, enabling the model to detect whether certain teams or styles of play are more prone to rubber band dynamics.

Finally, the rubber band effect extends beyond basketball and could be explored in football, hockey, and professional leagues such as the NBA and NFL. These sports also exhibit phases of aggressive catch-up behavior and late-game conservatism, and score-differential regressions may be detectable using similar Markov or reinforcement-learning-based frameworks. Linking score differential to field position in football, turnover events, or penalty sequences could help generalize the phenomenon across sports. Other areas outside of sports analytics could also benefit from a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, such as psychological trends in personal, financial, and political spaces that can all be influenced by complacency and disruption effects.

In summary, while the Markov model provides an interpretable and data-driven approach to analyzing point-differential dynamics, it also highlights the complexities of modeling competitive momentum. The project reveals encouraging evidence of the rubber band effect but also illustrates the importance of contextual modeling and richer data sources for future work.
